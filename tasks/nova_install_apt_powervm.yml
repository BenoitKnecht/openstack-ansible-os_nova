# When updating the cache in the apt_repository
# task, and the update fails, a retry does not
# detect a change the second attempt and therefore
# does not update the cache, resulting in a changed
# repo config, but no updated cache. To work around
# this bug we implement the change of repo config
# and the cache update as two seperate tasks.
