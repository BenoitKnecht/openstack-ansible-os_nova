deprecations:
  - |
    The upstream noVNC developers recommend that the keymap be automatically
    detected for virtual machine consoles. The defaults for three Ansible
    variables have been removed:

    * nova_console_keymap
    * nova_novncproxy_vnc_keymap
    * nova_spice_console_keymap

    The ``nova.conf`` template still includes these variables and it sets the
    keymap configuration option. Deployers who have customized this setting
    will not see a change in their ``nova.conf``.
